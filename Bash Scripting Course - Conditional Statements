# Demonstrates how to use conditional statements 

############## pass parameters ##############
# first we need to discuss how to pass parameters that can be used in conditionals 
# script to show how to pass variables to scripts in the CLI
# create file
vim cmdlinevar.sh
#!/bin/bash

# demo of cmd line values passed in with our shell script
echo "The following item was passed into the script at run time $1" # in this case counting starts at 1 rather than 0 like many other computer counting does 

# exit and chmod u+x and execute to show that there's nothing displayed for $1 if there's no variable passed 
cmdlinevar.sh # displays nothing for $1
cmdlinevar.sh helloWorld # passed into script
cmdlinevar.sh hello world # only hello
cmdlinevar.sh "Hello World" # passes whole string with spaces
cmdlinevar.sh `expr 2 + 2` # passes in value of expr


# replace $1 in output string with variable to make it easier to read your code, know what the variables are used for and reuse in the script
vim cmdlinevar.sh 
USRENAME=$1
PASSWORD=$2
echo "The following username is $USERNAME and password is $PASSWORD" 

############## if statement ##############
 # if statements are the first conditional we will talk about and they are used to guide the computer in decision making and control the eb and flow of execution. 
 # we're keeping them outside of functions for now, but it gives us the ability to test for a wide variety of things (files, strings, ints comparison, etc )
 vim if.sh 
 #!/bin/bash
 # simple if statement script for guessing a number
 
 echo "Guess the Secret Number"
 echo "========================"
 echo ""
 echo "Enter a Number Between 1 and 5: "
 read GUESS
 if [ $GUESS -eq 3 ] # -eq is the same as == in some languages
   then
     echo "You  Guessed the Correct Number!"
 fi # if statements in bash end with a reverese if -> fi
 
 
 # example #2 we will test if a file exists via if statements
 vim testFile.sh 
 #!/bin/bash
 # tests for the existence of indicated file name
 
 FILENAME="mytest.txt" #can change "mytest.txt" to $1 to pass in param via cli
 echo "Testing for the existence of a file called $FILENAME" 
 
 fi [ -a $FILENAME ] # changing to [ ! -a $FILENAME ] will test for the file being nonexistent
   then 
     echo "File $FILENAME does exist" 
 fi
 
 
 # test for multiple values
 vim twovars.sh
 #!/bin/bash
 # tests multiple expressions in single if statement 
 
 FileNAME=$1
 
 echo "Testing for file $FILENAME and readability" 
 
 if [ -f $FILENAME ] && [ -r $FILENAME ]
   then 
     echo "File $FILENAME exists AND is readable"
fi


# if then else
