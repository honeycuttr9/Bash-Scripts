##### Bash Script Basics #####

# What makes a bash script? 
# Starts a new shell and executes cmds in that shell and is independant of the current user environment

vim test.sh # .sh is not required, but is helpful to identify on ls 
#!/bin/bash
clear
echo "Hello World"
esc wq! 
chmod u+x test.sh
test.sh 

# Environment Variables
env # displays all env variables

# Environment variables can be accessed when using the dollar sign in front of the variable and they are typically designated with all caps
# Below is a shell script that outputs the value of environment variables. 
vim environment.sh
#!/bin/bash
clear
echo "This script will give us environment info"
echo "========================================="
echo "Hello Username: $USER"
echo ""
echo "Your Home Directory is: $HOME"
echo ""
echo "Your History File Will Ignore: $HISTCONTROL"
echo ""
echo "Your Terminal Session Type is: $TERM"
echo ""

# update permissions
chmod u+x * # gives execute permissions for the user on everything in the directory.
